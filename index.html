      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Alex"><h4>Alex</h4></a>
      <p>Alex loves sports and hanging out at the beach. He is quite arrogant and brags to everyone that he is going to
        be a professional athlete. Is his cockiness just a facade to mask his crushing self-doubt? Is he using his
        sports dream to fill the void left by the disappearance of his parents? Or is he just a brazen youth trying to
        'look cool?</p>

      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Elliott"><h4>Elliot</h4></a>
      <p>Elliott lives alone in a cabin on the beach. He is a writer who dreams of one day writing a magnificent novel.
        He is a sentimental “romantic” with a tendency to go off onto flowery, poetic tangents. When he can afford it,
        he enjoys a strong beverage at the Stardrop Saloon. Could a humble farmer such as yourself be the inspiration
        Elliott is looking for? There’s only one way to find out…</p>

      <img src="images/men/harvey.jpeg">
      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Harvey"><h4>Harvey</h4></a>
      
      <p>Harvey is the town doctor. He’s a little old for a bachelor, but he has a kind heart and a respected position
        in the community. He lives in a small apartment above the medical clinic, but spends most of his time working.
        You can sense a sadness about him, as if there’s something he’s not telling you…</p>

    <div id="col4" class="column">
      <img src="images/men/sam.jpeg">
      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sam"><h4>Sam</h4></a>
    
      <p>Sam is an outgoing, friendly guy who is brimming with youthful energy. He plays guitar and drums, and wants to
        start a band with Sebastian as soon as he has enough songs together. However, he does have a habit of starting
        ambitious projects and not finishing them. Sam is a little stressed about the impending return of his father,
        who has been away for years due to his line of work.</p>

    <div id="col5" class="column">
      <img src="images/men/sebastian.jpeg">
      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sebastian"><h4>Sebastian</h4></a>
      
      <p>Sebastian is a rebellious loner who lives in his parents’ basement. He is Maru’s older half-brother, and feels
        like his sister gets all the attention and adoration, while he is left to rot in the dark. He tends to get
        deeply absorbed in his work, computer games, comic books, sci-fi novels, and will sometimes spend great lengths
        of time pursuing these hobbies alone in his room. He can be a bit unfriendly to people he doesn’t know. Could a
        charming new farmer cultivate the wasteland of his heart? Who knows?</p>

      <img src="images/men/shane.jpeg">
      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Shane"><h4>Shane</h4></a>
    
      <p>Shane is a villager in Pelican Town who is often rude and unhappy, and suffers from depression and alcohol
        dependence. However, his attitude starts to change towards any player who chooses to befriend him. He works at
        JojaMart most days between 9am and 5pm unless the Community Center is completed, and frequently spends his
        evenings in The Stardrop Saloon. He doesn't work on the weekend except on rainy days, and is frequently around
        the ranch.</p>

      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Abigail"><h4>Abigail</h4></a>
      
      <p>Abigail lives at the general store with her parents. She sometimes fights with her mom, who worries about
        Abigail’s “alternative lifestyle”. Her mom has the following to say: “I wish Abby would dress more appropriately
        and stop dyeing her hair blue. She has such a wonderful natural hair color, just like her grandmother did. Oh,
        and I wish she’d find some wholesome interests instead of this occult nonsense she’s into.” You might find
        Abigail alone in the graveyard, or maybe out in a rainstorm looking for frogs.</p>

      <img src="images/women/emily.jpeg">
      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Emily"><h4>Emily</h4></a>
      
      <p>Emily is a villager who lives in Pelican Town. She is one of the twelve characters available to marry. Her home
        is south of the town square, right next to Jodi's house, at the address 2 Willow Lane. She works most evenings
        at The Stardrop Saloon starting at about 4:00 PM. Emily loves to make her own clothing, but fabric can be
        difficult to come by in town. Among her favorite gifts are cloth and wool.

      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Haley"><h4>Haley</h4></a>
      
      <p>Being wealthy and popular throughout high school has made Haley a little conceited and self-centered. She has a
        tendency to judge people for superficial reasons. But is it too late for her to discover a deeper meaning to
        life? Is there a fun, open-minded young woman hidden within that candy-coated shell?</p>

    <div id="col10" class="column">
      <img src="images/women/leah.jpeg">
      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Leah"><h4>Leah</h4></a>
      
      <p>Leah lives alone in a small cabin just outside of town. She loves to spend time outside, foraging for a wild
        meal or simply enjoying the gifts of the season. She’s a talented artist with a large portfolio of work… yet
        she’s too nervous to display it to the public. Maybe you can give her a little confidence boost?</p>

    <div id="col11" class="column">
      <img src="images/women/maru.jpeg">
      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Maru"><h4>Maru</h4></a>
      
      <p>Growing up with a carpenter and a scientist for parents, Maru acquired a passion for creating gadgets at a
        young age. When she isn’t in her room, fiddling with tools and machinery, she sometimes does odd jobs at the
        local clinic. Friendly, outgoing, and ambitious, Maru would be quite a lucky match for a lowly newcomer such as
        yourself… Can you win her heart, or will she slip through your fingers and disappear from your life forever?</p>

      <img src="images/women/penny.jpeg">
      <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Penny"><h4>Penny</h4></a>
      
      <p>Penny lives with her mom, Pam, in a little trailer by the river. While Pam is out carousing at the saloon,
        Penny quietly tends to her chores in the dim, stuffy room she is forced to call home. She is shy and modest,
        without any grand ambitions for life other than settling in and starting a family. She likes to cook (although
        her skills are questionable) and read books from the local library.</p>
